            <h2>"The practice of yogasana for the sake of health, to keep fit, or to maintain flexibility is the external practice of yoga. While this is a legitimate place to begin, it is not the end … Even in simple asanas, one is experiencing the three levels of quest: the external quest, which brings firmness of the body; the internal quest, which brings steadiness of intelligence; and the innermost quest, which brings benevolence of spirit."<br> B.K.S. Iyengar.</h2>

              <p> B.K.S Iyengar was an influential yoga master born in southern India in 1918, and is widely credited with bringing yoga to the west. From a young age he dedicated his life to the practice, and to sharing his wisdom and passion for the art, science and philosophy of yoga. The teachings of B.K.S Iyengar are deeply grounded in the ancient Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.
              B.K.S Iyengar wrote many books on yoga including the modern classic, Light on Yoga, first published in 1966, and more recently the inspirational gift of a book.</p>
